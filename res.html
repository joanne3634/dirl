Increasing the Level of Dissemination and Interactivity through Peer-to-Peer Connectivity
</div>
<div style="padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:justify; padding-left:15px;">
I have a keen interest in research topics related to networked multimedia applications, especially audio, video, and games, over peer-to-peer overlay networks.  The success of Skype has made people aware of the potential of overlay networks: It proves that facilities not built into the infrastructure of Internet, such as multicast and QoS-aware routing, can now be easily realized with peer-to-peer overlay networks.  However, how overlay networks should be formed to achieve good performance is still an open question.  Moreover, different kinds of applications may require different underlying networks.  For example, responsiveness would be the most highlighted factor in games, while scalability would be of most concern in World-Cup Football live streaming.

Understanding the Behavior and Characteristics of the Internet
</div>
<div style="padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:justify; padding-left:15px;">
With decentralized control and both unintentional and deliberate disruptions, the dynamics of Internet are now very difficult to understand. Observation, i.e., measurement, is probably the only way to understand such complex systems. However, given the immense size of the Internet and the fact that it changes so rapidly, accurate measurement of the whole Internet in order to understand its behavior would be extremely difficult, if not impossible. Understanding Internet behavior is important to network system designers, as it significantly affects how well applications perform. In addition to simply capturing all the data we can observe and then analyzing the measured trace, I am particularly interested in statistical techniques for sampling because of the excessive amount of data. For example, based on my own experience, recording the traffic of a MMORPG for three hours takes 140 GB of storage; such an amount of data makes it difficult to continuously monitor the traffic over the long-term. How to sample observations of the Internet in terms of accuracy, storage, complexity, and timeliness remains a challenging research topic. I would also like to pursue this line of research in the future.

Stopping the Fire, or at least Limiting the Damage: Surviving Attacks
</div>
<div style="padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:justify; padding-left:15px;">
In recent years, there has been a continuous rise in the volume of malicious traffic, mainly DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) and worm attacks, on the Internet. Due to the distributed design of the medium, it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify the “true” sender of a certain packet. Thus, while some researchers try to develop IP traceback techniques to pinpoint the true originator of malicious traffic, other researchers are proposing ways of surviving certain networks or hosts under severe attack. I am interested in this area because: 1) the threat of attacks on the legitimate use of Internet is already vast and increasing rapidly; and 2) the immense amount of malicious traffic, which can be seen as “background radiation,” has made accurate measurement of legitimate traffic much more difficult. In the future, I would like to investigate issues related to preventing, detecting, or at least surviving various kinds of malicious activities on the Internet.

Extending the Presence and Communication of Human Beings into the Virtual World
</div>
<div style="padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:justify; padding-left:15px;">
A Networked Virtual Environment (NVE), which is a superset of MMOGs, is a software system in which multiple users interact with each other in real-time, even though they may be physically located around the world. While NVEs were originally studied for use in military simulations, I believe that they will play a key role in social communication and entertainment services in the future. There are a number of research topics involved in creating NVE systems, namely, consistency, responsiveness, security, scalability, persistency, and reliability. As a continuation of my thesis work, I plan to further investigate the above design issues, especially those of most concern to users, e.g., responsiveness (network lag), and security problems, under the constraint of high scalability. Peer-to-peer architecture might be a promising solution for scalability, however, it raises many additional problems related to consistency, performance, and cheating. Such complexities make designing an NVE system that balances various design goals much more challenging and interesting, which is why I would like to work on this topic in the future.
